# Asl-gesture-recognition
A real-time application for recognizing American Sign Language gestures using Mediapipe and TensorFlow.

# ASL Gesture Recognition using Mediapipe and TensorFlow 
This project translates American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures into text in real time. The application uses Mediapipe for hand tracking, TensorFlow for gesture classification, and OpenCV for webcam integration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- Libraries: Mediapipe, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Numpy

## File Structure
- `data_collection.py`: Script to collect and save hand gesture data.
- `train_model.py`: Script to preprocess data and train the TensorFlow model.
- `real_time_recognition.py`: Script for real-time gesture recognition.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
